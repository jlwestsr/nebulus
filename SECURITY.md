## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
rejected, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Since this project allows AI models to access the local file system and execute certain commands, please treat command injection and path traversal vulnerabilities as high priority.

Verified vulnerabilities will be addressed in the next patch release.
